# Tactic

An experimental Discord.js chat-games bot in-progress.

To use, create a file called secrets.json and put a valid token inside.
Then do npm install within Tactic's directory to install necessary packages, and finally nodemon to host Tactic.

Your secrets.json should look like:

{
  "token": "YOURTOKENHERE"
}
