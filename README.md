# Tactic

Tactic is a bot which can play Tic-Tac-Toe in Discord Guild chats.

It is currently unfinished, and can only host a single game at a time.

## Installation
First, execute ```npm install``` in Tactic's directory. Then, create a file called secrets.json and put a valid token inside.

Your secrets.json should look like:
```
{
  "token": "YOURTOKENHERE"
}
```
Change YOURTOKENHERE to a token from the [Discord developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers).

## Execution
To run Tactic, execute ```nodemon``` in its directory.
